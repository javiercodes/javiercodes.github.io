    "The way this post is going to be organized is first I will be writing about some of the lessons I personally learned through this challenge with linked audio files, and then followed up with what came out of it, and then the stats on the run itself (how much weight loss, distance etc.). Thank you.",
  p2:
    "Alright so, this is just gonna be an audio diary of my thoughts so far. I think one of the main lessons here is although something might seem far visually, it might not actually be that far with regards to distance. So what that means is you know, maybe you set a goal, seems a little ambitious, seems like you might not be able to get there. The moral of the story here is, it might not be that far. The only way to know is to get started.",
  p3:
    "Second thing is, having a goal that is visual, that you can visualize is important. Because although every so often you have to keep your vision low (when you're running) you know, wanna make sure you don't trip, every so often you can look up and see where you're at [The mountain for me]. When you set a goal for yourself visualize it, see yourself there, then start, and every so often check in on your progress. That's it for now.",
  p4:
    "Alright so a couple more lessons. Uh. One sec. Obviously [this is me talking to myself, ignore my brute language], most obvious one is on dead ends. Sometimes when you're close to being where you wanna be, you hit a dead end, don't let that stop you. Find a way around, and keep going. It's easy to let those things stop you. You know, being [just] feet away from your goal. [But] That's when you shouldn't stop, take the long route.",
  p5:
    "Second is, sometimes when you do things that are difficult, there are people around you who might genuinely care about you. And because of that, because they care about your wellbeing, they'll tell you to stop. DON'T. The caveat being, don't be stupid, obviously, right now, this being the longest distance I've ran, the temperature change, the altitude change, this isn't easy. And I think you're body knows it, so take your precautions. So one of my precautions right now is sharing my location with my mother. Who at the end of this run is going to pick me up. That's a precaution. Getting this bag of water so I don't dehydrate, that's a precaution. Getting this headlight, that's a precaution. Don't be stupid, but don't stop, that's it.",
  p6:
    "Alright so, another thought is about setting things that remind you about why you're doing what you're doing. The reason this thought came up, is because I see a house all the way up on the hill. And that reminds me about the level of success I want to attain. Set those up, set those post, those goal posts. In between where you are now and where you want to be. To remind you of why you're doing what you're doing.",
  p7:
    "The audio after this point becomes terrible, so I wont be posting them.] Another lesson is on success metrics. You know, when you set your goals, often times it's difficult to decide what consistutes you being 'done'. When I embarked on this journey I hadn't decided that yet. I just thought once I get to the base of the mountain I'm done. But that wasn't specific enough. When I hit those dead ends as you likely saw on my instgram account, I was feet away from the base of the mountain. Does that count as success? Not sure. So what I decided is that this run is over when my Google map tells me it's over. That's when I see my GPS marker physically on the mountain.",
  p8:
    " From this completely unplanned adventure, I've decided to implement a year long challenge for myself. Which entails doing one thing, each month which I consider to be difficult, something I've never done before, or something I tried, but failed at in the past. This idea is heavily influenced by one of my favorite people David Goggins, author of 'Can't hurt me' who says that you should: 'do atleast one thing that sucks, every day'.",
